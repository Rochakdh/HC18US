When loading, images are typically converted to a single-channel format.
Ground truth (GT) images are provided without a channel dimension.
In PyTorch, image inputs must be in C × H × W format.
Loss functions expect labels in H × W format since the channel dimension is not needed.



To modify your U-Net model so that it processes inputs of arbitrary sizes without using interpolation (F.interpolate) inside the forward method, you need to address two key issues caused by removing the resizing steps: (1) ensuring that the encoder and decoder feature maps align spatially for concatenation during the decoder path, and (2) making the final output match the original input size without relying on interpolation. Here's how you can achieve this:

Understanding the Problem
In your original code, the input is resized to (800, 544)—dimensions divisible by 16 (since 
2
4
=
16
2 
4
 =16, matching four max-pooling layers)—processed through the U-Net, and then resized back to the original size using interpolation. Each max-pooling operation (with kernel size 2 and stride 2) halves the spatial dimensions, and each upsampling operation doubles them. For an input not divisible by 16, the repeated floor division in max-pooling causes the dimensions to shrink slightly more than expected, leading to mismatches during concatenation and an output size smaller than the input. Interpolation was used to enforce compatibility and restore the original size, but since you’re handling resizing elsewhere, the model must operate without it internally.

Solution Overview
Remove interpolation: Process the input directly at its original size.
Handle concatenation: Crop the encoder feature maps to match the upsampled decoder feature maps, as the encoder maps may be larger due to floor division in max-pooling.
Match output size: Pad the final output to the original input size, since the processed size after four downsamplings and upsamplings may be smaller than the input.
Step-by-Step Modification
Store the Original Input Size
At the start of the forward method, save the input’s spatial dimensions using orig_size = x.shape[-2:]. This will be used later to pad the output.
Remove Input Interpolation
Delete the line x = F.interpolate(x, size=(800, 544), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False). The input x will now be processed at its original size, say (540, 800) as an example.
Encoder Path
Keep the encoder path as is. Each self.downX block typically contains convolutional layers that maintain spatial dimensions (with padding), followed by self.maxpool, which reduces the size via floor division. For an input of (540, 800):
x1: (540, 800) after self.down1
x2: (270, 400) after self.maxpool, then self.down2
x3: (135, 200) after self.maxpool, then self.down3
x4: (67, 100) after self.maxpool, then self.down4
x5: (33, 50) after self.maxpool, then self.bottleneck
Decoder Path with Cropping
In the decoder, each upsampling step (e.g., self.up4) doubles the spatial dimensions of its input. However, due to floor division in the encoder’s max-pooling, the corresponding encoder feature map (e.g., x4) may be slightly larger than the upsampled feature map. Before concatenation, crop the encoder feature map to match the upsampled size:
After x = self.up4(x5): If x is (66, 100), but x4 is (67, 100), crop x4 to (66, 100).
Use x4_cropped = x4[:, :, :Hx, :Wx], where Hx and Wx are the height and width of x.
Apply this cropping before each torch.cat operation, after the dropout layers.
Pad the Final Output
After x = self.final(x), the output size depends on the input size and the four downsampling/upsampling cycles. For an input of (540, 800), the output might be (528, 800) because 
33
×
16
=
528
33×16=528 (height) and 
50
×
16
=
800
50×16=800 (width). To match the original (540, 800):
Compute padding: pad_H = orig_size[0] - current_H, pad_W = orig_size[1] - current_W.
Use F.pad with mode='replicate' to extend the borders by replicating edge values, avoiding interpolation.

def forward(self, x):
    # Save original dimensions
    orig_size = x.shape[-2:]  # (H, W), e.g., (540, 800)

    # Encoder path
    x1 = self.down1(x)
    x2 = self.maxpool(x1)
    x2 = self.down2(x2)
    x3 = self.maxpool(x2)
    x3 = self.down3(x3)
    x4 = self.maxpool(x3)
    x4 = self.down4(x4)
    x5 = self.maxpool(x4)
    x5 = self.bottleneck(x5)

    # Decoder path with cropping
    x = self.up4(x5)
    x = self.dropout4(x)
    Hx, Wx = x.shape[2], x.shape[3]
    x4_cropped = x4[:, :, :Hx, :Wx]  # Crop x4 to match x
    x = torch.cat([x, x4_cropped], dim=1)
    x = self.conv4(x)

    x = self.up3(x)
    x = self.dropout3(x)
    Hx, Wx = x.shape[2], x.shape[3]
    x3_cropped = x3[:, :, :Hx, :Wx]  # Crop x3 to match x
    x = torch.cat([x, x3_cropped], dim=1)
    x = self.conv3(x)

    x = self.up2(x)
    x = self.dropout2(x)
    Hx, Wx = x.shape[2], x.shape[3]
    x2_cropped = x2[:, :, :Hx, :Wx]  # Crop x2 to match x
    x = torch.cat([x, x2_cropped], dim=1)
    x = self.conv2(x)

    x = self.up1(x)
    x = self.dropout1(x)
    Hx, Wx = x.shape[2], x.shape[3]
    x1_cropped = x1[:, :, :Hx, :Wx]  # Crop x1 to match x
    x = torch.cat([x, x1_cropped], dim=1)
    x = self.conv1(x)

    x = self.final(x)

    # Pad output to match original size
    current_H, current_W = x.shape[2], x.shape[3]
    pad_H = orig_size[0] - current_H
    pad_W = orig_size[1] - current_W
    if pad_H > 0 or pad_W > 0:
        x = F.pad(x, (0, pad_W, 0, pad_H), mode='replicate')

    return x

    
Why This Works
No Interpolation: Both F.interpolate calls are removed. Cropping adjusts feature map sizes for concatenation, and padding adjusts the final output size.
Arbitrary Input Sizes: The model processes the input as-is, with max-pooling and upsampling handling any size. Cropping ensures compatibility in the decoder, and padding ensures the output matches the input size.
Preserves U-Net Structure: The encoder-decoder paths and skip connections are intact, with only size adjustments via cropping and padding.
Notes
Padding Mode: mode='replicate' extends the output by copying border values, suitable for segmentation tasks to avoid introducing artificial zeros (unlike mode='constant' with value 0). Alternatively, mode='reflect' could be used, but replicate is often preferred for boundary consistency.
Performance Impact: The small padding (e.g., 12 pixels in height from 528 to 540) occurs at the borders and, if the model is trained with such outputs, should have minimal impact on segmentation accuracy.
External Handling: Since you mentioned handling resizing elsewhere, this model outputs the exact input size without interpolation, fulfilling the requirement while leaving final adjustments (if any) to external code.
This modified forward method allows your U-Net to handle arbitrary input sizes without internal interpolation, matching the original input dimensions through cropping and padding.
